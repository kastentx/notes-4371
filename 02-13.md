# Bell-LaPadula Model
* Subjects are issued _Security Clearance_.
* Objects have _Security Classification_.
* Security levels arranged linearly
  * Top Secret (highest)
  * Secret
  * Confidential
  * Unclassified (lowest)

## Reading Information
* "Reads up" disallowed, "reads down" allowed
* A lower clearance person _cannot_ read from a level above their own.
* A higher clearance person _can_ read from levels below their own.

## Writing Information
* "Writes up" allowed, "writes down" disallowed
* A higher clearance person _cannot_ write for a level below their own.
* A lower clearance person _can_ write for levels higher than their own.

## Access Control Matrix
* **Objects** are sorted in descending order, according to their security classification.
* **Subjects** are sorted in descending order, according to their secuirty clearance.

## Mechanisms

### Ring-Based
* textbook defines ring-based as _not_ having a 'write-only' clearance level, so we need to redefine it.
* we can modify ring-based for our needs by giving a  ring to subject _and_ a ring to object
  * instead of a ring to subject only..
* assume lower ring number = higher clearance level
  * if r<sub>s</sub> < r<sub>o</sub> -> `read only`
  * if r<sub>s</sub> = r<sub>o</sub> -> `read/write`
  * if r<sub>s</sub> > r<sub>o</sub> -> `write only`

### Access Control Lists
### Capability Lists

## Problems with model (Step 1)
* Consider a general in charge of two teams..
* The teams should not have knowledge of each other
  * if they are both placed on the same clearance level, they would be able to access each other's info

## Bell-LaPadula Model (Step 2)
* to solve: expand notion of security level to include _categories_
  * a category corresponds to a set of information
    * ( Top Secret, { NUC, EUR, ASI } )
    * ( Confidential, { EUR, ASI } )
* with categories, security levels only partially ordered
  * any pair of security levelsl may (or may not) be related by _dom_
*
