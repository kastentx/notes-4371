# Cryptographic Checksums cont.

## Random Numbers
* rand() functions are pseudo-random
  * they seem random, but htey aren't
  * given enough, you can crack the code and predict them
* secure hash functions are more legit

## HMAC
* make keyed cryptographic checksums from keyless cryptographic checksums
* not a direct hash
  * uses a pad around the message to disguise it

## Ciphers
* different types needed to decrypt different things

# Digital Signature
* something that proves a message came from a certain sender
* not intended to provide confidentiality.. used to protect **integrity**
* can't share keys among users.. that is not a valid digital signature
* a third party can be used that will resolve 'disputes' and decipher messages
* if the signature is _truly_ secure it won't be vulnerable to the obvious "known plaintext" attack

## Common Error
* symmetric encryption
  * shared key
  * symetric key
  * pairwise key
  * secret key
* asymmetric encryption 

## Public Key Digital Signatures
* don't sign two messages.. they can be combined and used against you
  * by multiplying two signed messages, you get the same thing as two individually signed messages combined
  * you should sign on the hash of the message
* proper sending process:
  1. Sign the message (which has already been hashed)
  2. Encrypt the message (with public key from receiver)
* proper receiving process:
  1. decrypt the message (which produces the hash)
  2. verify that message matches hash (recompute hash. check if hash matches decrypted signature. done with senders public key)
  3. if they don't match, we know that something has been sabotoged

## What's NEW in Security?
* security/cost/performance at odds with each other
* block ciphers are getting longer (symmetric)
  * need 128-bit at least to be considered secure
* sha1 no longer super secure.. now need sha2 (many variaties)

# CH9: Key Management

* KEY is one component of a security system
* **nonces** - nonrepeating random numbers

## Session and Interchange Keys
* assume public key encryption
* when a new session starts, _session key_ is generated
  * this is used to encrypt the plaintext data
* an _interchange key_ is used to decrypt the _session key_ only
