# Malicious Logic (cont.)

## Executable Infectors
* a virus that infects executable programs
  * can be put anywhere in the program's code.. but must also be modified to run it
* a program (file) contains 3 main components:
  * meta information
  * code
  * aux
* if malicious code is inserted into code seciton... addresses of sections will get messed up
  * this produces an error
* `libelf` library can manipulate ELF file
  * displays all sections
  * allows you to add stuff to selected sections
  * can produce a new executable
  * typically used for compiling software

### Meta-Information
* ELF - executable file format for linux 
  * "magic" number identifies it as an ELF file
  * contains addressses to sections located in Code section
  * section headers include:
    * text section = code
    * got section = function table
    * stack section = the stack
* PE - executable file format for windows

### Code
* the actual code of the program is stored here
* the addresses from the section headers (meta-inf) corresonds to something located here

### Aux
* debugging information

## TSR Virus
* do viruses terminate/go away when a user logs out?
  * NO! make a daemon... setsid() call runs the service as root
* ps -> lib -> kernal -> PC
  * every component has a process and a data structure
* `ps` is built on top of `readproc`
* in linux, the goal is to hook malicious code to system library
* in windows, the goal is to hook malicious code into a DLL
* Linux System Monitor still shows trojan process, even though it is hidden from ps
  * this is because the are built on top of different things
    * ps uses the library
    * System Monitor (graphic ps) gets data directly from kernal
    * if you change the kernal, this would affect both types of process lists
* `lib-gtop` library used - "graphic table of processes"
* after hiding malicious process, next step is to hide the file (virus) on the hard drive
  * hook code into the library that `ls` uses, so `ls` won't be able to display it

## Encrypted Viruses
* a virus that's encrypted except for a small decrypting routine
  * this makes detection much harder as virus signature is now hidden
* deciphering routine uses its stored key to decrypt code, then runs the malicious code after it is decrypted

## Polymorphic Viruses
* using different instructions (with different bit patterns) that achieve the same thing
* plain text

# Exam 1
* T or F questions
* Multiple Choice questions
* Short Answer questions
  * these will be similar to questions from the textbook
* there won't be anything similar to the CTF questions
* will focus on the concepts of security, rather than code/networking
* one cheat sheet is allowed (double-sided OK)
* exam will be 5-6 pages (maybe about 20 questions)
* some students might finish in 30 mins, but some might also take the whole time
* some easy questions, some hard ones
* average score is typically in 75-80 range
* no calculator
* bring PENCIL

# Slides that we'll need to review

## Lec01
* goal of security
* confidentiality
* threats
* policies and mechanisms
  * what are they
  * what is their relation
* trust
* NO operational/human issues

## Lec02
* access control matrix
  * subject
  * object
  * rights
* acm cases and examples
* access control mechanisms
* what is ACL?
  * how to use it
  * different issues
    * abbreviations, etc.
  * how to modify ACL
  * groups
  * conflicts
  * handling default permissions
* NO iptables
* Capability Lists
  * what is it?
  * how to use
  * examples
* ACL vs Capabilities
  * similarities and differences
* Ring-Based access control
  * what is it
  * access brackets
  * what kind of matrix's can be implemented, or what cannot
    * something with append not possible w/ ring-based? write but no read maybe?
* Models of Access Control slides

## Lec03
* concept of confidentiality policy
* concept of integrity policy
* Bell-LaPuda model
  * security level
  * who can read 
  * who can write
  * how to use mechanism to enforce ACM
* concept of category set with Bell-LaPuda
  * read/write again, with category
  * understand the dominance with categories
  * given different levels and sets, can you create ACM?
* Biba model
  * only need to understand read and write... NOT execution
  * given biba model.. create access control matrix
* nothing on LOCUS or specific systems
* History - types of malicious logic
  * will look at some malicious code (C or C++)
    * understand the logic
    * what's going on in memory
    * if you find the flaw in the code.. can you exploit it?? **<- challenging part of exam**
* what is trojan horse
  * identify trojan or not by looking at code/virus
* what is a virus?
  * insertion + execution
  * look at the pseudocode of virus
    * what purpose does each line have?
* types of viruses
  * each type/example represents part of the virus pseudocode
  * know what each type does... what it looks like
