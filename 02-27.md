# Stack Overflow Attack
* first attempted address will most likely fail
* add 40 to get to the next address (remember hex numbering)
  * recompile and check for success
  * should take about 10 tries.. if too many
    * maybe security not disabled
    * maybe starting address is wrong
* example:
  * buf (0000, 7fff, ffff, d468)
    * code will have to be at an address _higher_ than this
      * buffer -> return address -> code

## How to get buffer address
* first run the code to disable security
* then run tcph in kdbg
* put some input so code will hit breakpoint
* typecast buf to char pointer, and the value is what you use as starting address
  * this is done in the "Watches" section, about the local variables display
* actual address in target machine will always be higher than address you find in debugger

## Explaining the Professors code
* why are `nops` needed?
  * buf
  * ret
  * nops
  * shellcode
* return address has to point _exactly_ to the address of the first line of malicious code (shellcode)
* block of nops is placed before the shellcode (called a **sled**)
* if return address falls within the block of nops, PC will increment until it hits first line of code
  * provides a much bigger target than a single address
  * bigger is better... but everything must fit within one network packet
* professor uses 128 bytes of nops in his code (0x80 in hex)
  * rule of thumb is to use half of block size as step size (thats how he got 40)

## Project 2
* we will need to calculate the chance a hacker could get in and attack
  * this will be based off the number of nops somehow
  * go by the professors office and talk with him about answer

### Metasploitable2
* virtual machine on our group's network
* 192.168.56.101 -> web interface (DVWA)
  * will have different types of attacks we can try
* set script security on this machine to 'low'
* use ' or true #' to perform SQL injection and get all users in DB 
  * the first quote closes the one from the backend code..
  * the # comments out the trailing quote

## Defense 
* paramterized SQL queries
* don't execute _any_ user input as code
* typecast input
