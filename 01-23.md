# Lab Info
* All groups get 3 time slots per week
* Each group gets assigned one subnet
  * includes 3 computers and 1 router
* one subnet marked 'x' is open to first come, first serve
* Lab opens to students up on the 12th day (after add/drops)
  * internal door needs student ID to open
* Use computers on Subnet A as _attackers_
* Use comupters/router on assigned subnet as _defenders_
* see professor's **8 steps to troubleshoot network problems** to fix issues
  * do these steps before asking for help

# Project 1
* Due in 4 weeks (Feb 20)
* task 1 involves starting services (httpd, sshd)
  * `service httpd status`
  * `service httpd start`
  * `service httpd stop`
* will use tools **Wireshark** and **NMap**

## Written Report:

* going over the 15 page limit will lose points
* if someone didn't do anything, don't mention them in summary
* screenshots should be included in report
  * make sure images match the text/caption
  * conflicting images/info will lose points

  * intro - 10 pts
  * other sections - 20 pts each
* 30 solo points
  * 15 for doing tasks
  * 15 for doing report

# Networking Basics
* use wireshark to capture packets
  * open up on the attacking computer
  * will show packets being transferred by client
  * use filters to show only desired info
    * `http` to see web traffic
* firewall sets rules based on ports, not service names
* **TCP** packets have header + payload
* **IP** packets have header + payload
  * payload contains complete **TCP** packets
  * header contains source+dest IP address
  * IPv4 address contain 4 bytes, each from (0-255)
  * port number must be smaller than 65535 (2 bytes)
