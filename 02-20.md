# Services

## TCPS

* Client & Server leave one port exposed for communication
* input interfaces mapped to this "network" socket
* `tcps` spawns an instance of `tcph`to interface with client
* NMAP can tell you which services, and what versions, are running on a remote server

## Buffer Overflow
* `strcpy` will copy char array until null terminator found
* if source is larger than destination, buffer overflow occurs
* discovered as an exploitable flaw in about 1994
  * stack smashing attack

### Reverse Engineering
* tools can be used to disassemble code from a running service
* Hopper is a tool that can be used on linux/mac
  * can generate pseudocode and disasseble (w/ full license)
* professional tool is called ida pro

### How to Exploit w/ Buffer Overflow
* KDbg is the tool we will use
  * be sure to compile with provided makefile
* run `kdbg tcph` on A.B or B.1 computer - NOT SERVER (B.2)
* set breakpoint on line with `strcpy`
  * should see read dot to indicate "break line"
* you'll have to type something and hit enter to get past `read` function call
* goal is to see what's currently stored in memory
* vairables will be listed in "locals" window
* `(char*)buf` command in the "watches" prompt will show you the memory address of the variable `buf`
  * Address: 12 hex digits.. (6 bytes) - group into 4s as a guide (0x 7FFF FFFF )
  * 2 bytes (4 hex digits) in the front aren't displayed 
    * the FULL address contains all these digits (to get to 64 bit)
* first functions to be called will occupy space higher on the stack (closer to 0xFFFFFFFFFFFF)
  * first function is likely going to be `main`
* first variables to be declared in function will be located towards high end of function
  * arguments are treated as being declared early, will go to top
* each subsequent function call gets memory lower on the stack (closer to 0x000000000000)
* caller's return address stored at the lowest point of its stack
  * will border the top of the callee's stack
* clicking on `+` sign in 'C' code window will show addresses
  * return address is the next line, after the `call`
* in "Memory:" prompt, you can input a hex address or a register name (D458)
  * search the nearby memory (D468) for the return address
