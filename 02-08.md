# Access Control Lists
* Used when subjects/objects are changing
  * add/remove a subject (row)
  * add/remove an object (column)
* common applications:
  * file systems - files (objects) change often
  * web server - users (subjects) change often
* stored on hard drive
* to change (hack):
  * become root
  * become owner
  * take out hard drive!

# Capability Lists
* Each subject has a permission list
* when a user(`s`) requests an operation(`p`) on object(`o`)...
  * retrieve the CL(`s`)
  * check if (`o`, `p`) matches an entry of CL(`s`)
  * if yes -> proceed; if no -> deny
* stored in kernel memory (not hard drive)
  * have to be root.. get into kernel 
  * much harder to hack than ACL

## Copying Permissions
* Is copying ACL possible... since its on hard drive?
  * full permission includes rights + owner + group + everyone else
  * no, because owner/group/others still applies
    * this can only be changed by `root`

# Ring-Based Access Control
* users grouped together in each ring have same rights
  * inner ring can read/write
  * middle ring can only read
  * outer ring has no rights
* you can have more rings.. but each group needs a distinct privelage level
* each subject can only have one ring number
  * can't change from object to object
  * if objects have conflicting privlage levels for a subject.. ring-based won't work
* in Linux.. lowest ring level is for user
* for execution, subject has ring number and object has _access bracket_ [a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, a<sub>3</sub>]
  * inner most ring allows access but generates a fault
  * next ring allows access but does not generate a fault
  * third ring allows access if through valid gate
  * outermost ring does not allow access

# Models of Access Control
* Entities involved in access control:
  * System, subject, object, the owner of the object, the creator of the object.
* Discretionary Access Control
  * _A child controls who can read his/her diary._
  * _A user controls the access of the  les he/she owns._
* Mandatory Access Control
  * _The law allows a court to access individual's driving records._
  * _The system controls the ownership of the  files._
* SELinux is a super-secure version of linux used by NSA
* Originator Controlled Access Control
  * _The distribution of a company's software is only allowed by the company._

## Confidentiality
* `X` set of entities as subject, `I` information as object
* `I` has confidentiality property with respect to `X` if no `x` value from `X` can obtain information from `I`
* `I` can be disclosed to others
