# Needham-Schroeder
* 5 steps of key exchange protocol
* process is covered in the slides as "Argument: Alice talking to Bob"
* is this system completely secure?
  * No. there really aren't _any_ systems that are 100% secure
  * there's always new types of attacks being created, and new methods are needed to stop them
  * when you design a new system, you'll think it's secure.. but then you find flaws as people use it
* k<sub>s</sub> is known as the "session key"
  * people can try to steal this (memory dumps, etc) and act as authenticated user
    * look at the slides for "Another Replay Attack"
* this is all based on symmetric encryption

## Denning-Sacco Modification (not on test?)
* solution to replay attack: use time stamp `T` to detect replay
  * weakness: if clocks aren't synced up, may reject valid or accept replays
* it's actually very hard to have the clocks on different devices be accurately synced
* currently, there is about a 10 second grace period in accepting messages

## Otway-Rees Protocol (not on test?)
* Get Bob involved early/on the first step
  * in needham-schroeder example.. Alice and Bob don't actually communicate until the 3rd step
  * since Bob is not involved on the 1st step, this introduces vulnerabilities
    * things can be exploited in this "gap"
* introduces `n` which is a 'sequence number' (what # message in the conversation)

## 3rd replay attack
* this example doesn't affect integrity, but uses 'Denial of Service'

# Kerberos
* super complicated system.. prof says it takes a week to install
* public system, so all the documentation is available online
  * you would need a team of people to read it all/understand it
* uses a central server as the authenticator.. like 'Cathy' in the previous examples
* `TGS` = ticket grant service
* goal of this system is to let the user use a service securely
* BIG BENEFIT of Kerberos -> seperation of duties:
  * user is managed by one computer
  * service runs on another computer
  * TGS acts as the bridge between them
* protocol slide (p. 25?) shows steps as an overview
  * each step on the slide actually represents many messages being sent back/forth
    * first user communicates with authentication server (cathy)
    * then user is granted access to talk with TGS
    * TGS give user a ticket
    * ticket is used to communicate with service and show authorization
* **Professor's informal summary**
  1. hey im good guy
  2. hey heres a ticket
  3. hey im a good guy cuz i have ticket
  4. here is your service ticket
  5. hey im a good guy cuz i have service ticket
  6. hey here is the service
* multiple TGS servers could be used for different types/levels of services
* based on **Needham-Schoeder** with the **Denning-Sacco modification**

## Probs with Kerberos
* relies on clocks
* older versions had weak session keys

# Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange
* g, p are public numbers
* each user picks a secret/random number (a and b)
* 1st step.. each user computes a new number based on random one (A and B)
* 2nd step, each user exchanges this computed number (A and B)
* 3rd step, new computation produces the same key for both users (k)
* Then, data can be exchanged
* even with the stuff exposed to the public (g, p, A, and B).. no one can crack A=g<sup>a</sup>%p or B=g<sup>b</sup>%p
* assymmetric solution... which is good because you don't need a third party (Cathy)

# RSA Based
* alice and bob communicate directly
* very simple.. but not totally secure
