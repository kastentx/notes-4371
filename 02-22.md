# Reverse Engineering / Binary Analysis

* 16 bytes on each row in Memory Browser
  * you can tell by the second digit in address incrementing by one
    * remember... base 16!
* `0xffffd680`
  * `80` is the first byte
  * `d6` is the second byte
  * `ff` is third byte
  * `ff` is fourth byte
* Each of the 4 blocks' addresses increments by 4
* in memory, ASCII strings will be replaced by hex values and vice versa
* if stack overflow occurs, the ascii string that was copied will have been converted to hex and will now occupy the "return address" for the function
  * PC will jump to whatever is at that address... could be junk or malicious code
* `strcpy` will stop when it sees zeros (there will always be some zeros in a 64-bit address)
* ch S[] ="01234567abcdefgh`\x20``\xD5` `\xFF``\xFF``\x7F``\x00``\x00` character array representation of a hex number
  * actually only 22 characters long.. according to C (because of null termination character)

* in project, we will need to change 'attack.c' code
  * lines will be marked with `!!!`
