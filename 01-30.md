# Chapter 1

## Goals of Security
* Prevention: prevent attackers from violating security policy
* Detection: detect attackers' violation of security policy
* Recovery: Stop attack, and asses/repair damage
* Retaliation: stop and capture attackers

## Basic Security Components
* Confidentiality: Keeping data/resources hidden
  * access & encryption
  * existence of data
* Integrity: Data/Origin integrity
  * authentication
* Availability: enabling access to data and resources
  * refer to reliability in the context of security
    * Reliability: usable when components fail
    * Availability: accessible when attacks happen
* Threat - potential violation of security
  * classes of threats:
    * violation of confidentiality, integrity, availability
    * Disclosure: unauthorized access to information
    * Deception: provision of false data
    * Disruption: interruption of correct operation
    * Usurpation: unauthorized control of system
      * _violates integrity because "controller/owner" of system has changed_
      * consequences of attack could also affect confidentiality, availability (not threat itself)
* Attack - action that violates security

## Threats
* Snooping
  * unauthorized interception of information
  * sniffing, eacesdropping
  * wiretapping attack
  * `iproute hijacking`
* Modification
  * unauthorized change of information
  * alteration
  * man-in-the-middle attack
* Spoofing
  * impersonation of another entity
  * masquerading
  * phishing
  * `source IP spoofing`
* Repudiation of origin
  * denial of sending information
* Denial of Receipt
  * denial of receiving information
* Delay
  * temporary inhibition of service
* Denial of Service
  * long-term inhibition of service

## Policies and Mechanisms
* Policy: statement of what is, and is not, allowed
  * if policies conflict or miss, disrepancies may create security vulnerabilities.
* Mechanism: methods, tools, procedures that enforce policies
  * if mechanisms are flawed, policies can be violated.

### Types of Mechanisms
* P: reachable states defined by the system
* Q: secure states defined by security policy
  * _students selected by the policy_
* R: restricted states defined by security mechanism
  * _students selected by the mechanism_
  * if R is a subset of Q -> (secure case)
  * if R equals Q -> (precise case)
    * you won't see this in the real world - too perfect!

## Trust
* **Trust is the assumption a secure system relies on.**
* Trustworthy Policies:
  * unambiguously partition system states into secure and insecure
  * correctly capture security requirements
* Trustworthy Mechanisms:
  * assumed to enforce policy
  * support mechanisms work correctly

## Non-Technical Issues
* Operational Issues
  * Cost-Benefit analysis:
    * is it worth protecting?
    * is it cheaper to prevent or repair?
  * Risk Analysis:
    * is an asset likely to be attacked?
  * Laws and Customs:
    * Are desired security measures illegal?
      * ex: exportation of cryptographic tech
* Human Issues

### Sniffing Tutorial
* need a socket (OS) for app to talk to network card
  * in this way OS can manage what apps can access network card
  * only one socket (raw) can be used for sniffing
* get the interface index of `lo`, netdevice, man ioctl and netdevice
  * `lo` network refers to loopback (emulated card)
    * localhost or 127.0.0.1
* bind socket to the `lo` interface, man packet and bind
* enable promisc in the socket, man netdevice
  * flip the bit to enable this
* receive message to the destination
* close the client socket
* MUST be done as root or socket won't allow sniffing
* PromiseQs mode?
  * for wifi.. "monitor mode" must also be enabled
  * these flags can be set/reset in wireshark

### Source IP Spoofing
* create socket with socketRAW
* create an IP packet from scratch, with desired IP source address in header
  * use the documentation for IP Header and ICMP to be able to create packet successfully
* NOTE - spoofing a source means replies won't get back to you
* 

# HW Notes
* Problem 1 - focus on the attack itself, not on the consequences of the attack
