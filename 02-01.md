# Access Control
* natural language description of security policy can be converted into a **matrix**
* `subject` (source)
  * entities that access the objects
    * computer being used
    * users (accounts)
      * actually represented by processes
    * processes
    * hosts
* `object` (destination)
  * entities to be protected
    * computer that can be accessed
    * user's file
    * machine level code (instructions)
      * provisioned vs. unprovisioned instructions
    * functions
    * processes (services)
    * hosts (addresses)
* rows are denoted by `i`
* columns are denoted by `j`

## Access Rights
* _permission is a mechanism to implement rights_
  * give "read permission" to certain users only
  * encrypt the file (uses the key as implementation)
* every security concern can have a "right" associated with it
  * change file
  * change file name
  * change timestamp
  * web service
  * ping
  * etc...
* Linux..
  * `Ownership` as a right is an **action**.
    * allows user to change rights on an object (file).
* Windows...
  * has more rights defined.. like `append`
    * this is implemented in Linux with a _flag_
* Network..
  * FTP example
    * download/upload can be set as different rights
    * connecting to a server is a right

## Interpretation of Rights
* Directories:
  * read: `r` permission allows user to view contents of directory
  * write: `w` permission allows user to add/change/remove contents of directory
  * execute: `x` permission allows access to contents of directory
* Files:
  * read: `r` permission allows user to view contents of file
  * write: `w` permission allows user to add/change/remove contents of file
  * execute: `x` permission allows you to run the file (like a program)
* while rights on different types of objects may have the same name, the _true_ rights are different depending on the type of object being talked about
  * the 3 rights on these 2 types of objects _actually_ represent **6 different rights**
* permission and rights are related, but not exactly the same
* in Linux, only `root` can change **ownership**

## ACM: Access Control Mechanisms
* Implementation:
  1. Define Security Policy
  2. Create Access Control Matrix
  3. Implement and put the ACM in storage
* When user `s` requests an operation `p` on an object `o`
  * check if `p` is in the entry `A(s,o)` of the ACM
    * if Yes -> proceed;
    * if No -> deny;

### Problems
* imagine a primitive approach to ACM (2D array)
* lots of processes on a computer... even more files
  * too many _subjects_ and _objects_ in matrix
  * no "precise" solution

## ACM Implementations
* `access control lists`
  1. define security policy
  2. create the access control matrix
  3. implement and put the ACL in storage
  * When user `s` requests an operation `p` on an object `o`
    1. retrieve the ACL(`o`)
    2. check if `(s,p)` matches an entry of `ACL(o)`.
      * if Yes -> proceed;
      * if No -> deny;
  * Defaults:
    * if not named -> _no_ rights over file
    * wildcards and groups used to deal with large number of subjects
      * **UNICOS** entries are in (user, group, rights) format
        * if _user_ is in group, has rights over file
        * `*` is wildcard for user, group
          * (holly, *, r): holly can read regardless of her group
          * (*, gleep, w): anyone in the group gleep can write to file
      * way easier to add a user to a group than to add a whole new row (user) to an access control matrix

### Groups in Unix
* 3 classes of users: owner, group, and rest - > `rwx rwx rwx`
