# Denial of Service
* `fork()` is used to duplicate processes
  * combined with recursive calls to generate large number of duplicates quickly
* **recursive execution** can be used in place of recursive calls to keep processes from dying
* C programs can be used to execute these types of attacks as well as shell code, python

## Zip Bombs
* small file that when unzipped, grows to a very large size
  * they're able to do this because of "low information entropy"
  * lots of zeros in a file, gets compressed very easily with zip compression

## Steganography
* data hidden within other data
  * done in images, pdf files, etc
* the legitmate file is called the _carrier_
  * data can be:
    * appended to a carrier
    * embedded as an object in carrier
    * trivial modification of data  
      * example: modify least significant bit of the Red value of RGB for each pixel
      * that bit put together in a string with all other R values represents the hidden data
* Steganography is one method secure information could be transmitted over our network in Project 1

# Defense
* no defense can defeat _any_ virus
* involves more than just anti-virus software and patching programs
* there are unknown flaws and malicious logic
* sometimes it is impossible to distinguish code (malicious or not) from data
* changing security policies can expose new vulnerabilities

## Data vs. Instructions

### LOCK System
* to prevent - have to keep users from turning data into code or vice versa (compilation)
* to examine after an attack - you can find out who turned data into code (or code -> data)
* compiled programs are _data_
* you can't modify _executable_ objects
  * once a program has been marked as an executable, don't allow modifications (like adding malicious code)

### Exec-Shield
* NX-Shield <- story of how an additional bit was added to computers that makes this method possible
* by default, the stuff on the stack is not executable
* we need a way for certain things to be executed though, for our computers to function
  * Flash web protocol is an example of this

### Mutual exclusion of write and execute
* allow rw, rx
* DON'T allow wx

## Limiting Accessibility
* Limiting the accessiblity of objects in a system should minimize the spread and damage caused by malicious logic

### Information Flow Metrics
* idea: limit distance a virus can spread
* count the "hops" or number of times a piece of data has been shared
* once a certain threshold (number of hops) has been reached, the data can no longer be written

#### Access Control Matrix
* Objects: objects with different IF metrics
* Subjects:
* Rights: determined by IF metrics
* Transition: change of IF metrics

### Reducing Protection Domain
* applying the principle of "least privilege"
* basic idea: remove rights from a process, so it only has enough access to perform its function

#### Access Control Matrix
* Objects:
* Subjects: dynamically created
* Rights: assigned according to needs
* Transition: no inheritage in newly created subjects

### Sandboxing
* providing an enclossed environment that doesn't have any connection to secure environment
  * Virtual Machines are a really good implementation of a sandbox

### Randomization
*
