# Defending against Malicious Logic

## Detect Alteration of Files
* MDC checksum for each file is generated and stored the first time computer boots up
* store them somewhere secure/remote
* when performance is lost, recompute MDC checksum and compare with original
  * if it has chnged, the file has been altered
* National Software Reference Library stores checksums for all major software releases
* number of items needed to scan equal to number of files (1 checksum per file)

## Antivirus Programs
* these programs scan files for "virus signatures"
* will update its list of known viruses by grabbing new data from a remote database
* can't deal with viruses that haven't been identified/analyzed yet

## Proof-Carrying Code
* example: "stack gaurd"
  * saw this on my macbook when I disassembled proj2 code
  * 'canary' is placed before a return address in memory
    * can be random
    * can be `0x000D0AFF` <- which terminates any type of string/copy method
  * compare the canary with data in memory at runtime
    * if it is different, something has been changed - abort!

## Detecting Statistical Changes
* compare activity to normal behavior
  * of a file, user, computer, etc.

## Analyze Statistical Characteristics
* will look at towards the end of semester

# Lab Project 3
* due 4/24 (4 weeks out)
* compromise the WiFi Access Point (using WEP)
* airCrack tool will be provided
  * tutorial included, but its old (should be installed on A computers)
  * others should be available online
* we will need to manage the WiFi card in many different ways (must be root)
  * described in tutorial
  * some steps in the process might cause the card to seem like its gone
    * if this happens, certain root user commands will bring it back
* we will need to figure out the right arguments for the commands we use
  * for example, channel number, MAC address
* if wifi card doesn't get an IP, we may have to manually set a static IP
  * the IP will have to be in the range of the internal network (not one of the ones already being used)
* assume we know computers' username, but not the password
* we are given a "dictionary" file (containing possible passwords)
  * test each of the passwords against the SSH login
  * do this with a program, not manually (example code provided)
    * modify by putting in the "file-reading" functionality
* once we hack in, we will access an encrypted file
  * not "pdf encryption" (by adobe) but something made by prof
  * crack the encryption once we discover how it is actually encrypted
  * NOTE: use a `KNOWN PLAINTEXT` attack (ceasar cipher?)
* there is a second encrypted file that uses DES encryption
  * if you crack this, you get an automatic A for the course
  * we probably won't actually be able to crack this

## Tips
* if you open a pdf file with a _text editor_ the first 8 bytes are the PDF version/header
  * example shown in assignment
* we will have to include in the report how long the passwords will take
  * should be some time between several hours and a couple days..
* measure the amount of keys we can try against the DES encyption
  * calculating the total amount of time it would need.. sometime between/around 100 and 1000 years
* must show that decryption program can work
  * use it on our own file, with a known key that we can confirm
  * then use this same program on professors file
* IN THE LAB:
  * do a "broadcast ping" form B.1
    * `ping -b whatever_IP_address`
    * ping can contain 64 bytes of any arbitrary data you want
    * if you don't, you'll sit in the lab all day without cracking wifi
    * if you do, you should be able to crack key in 1 minute
    * NOTE: this is a `CHOSEN PLAINTEXT` ATTACK

# Cryptography (CH 8 + CH 10)
* Classified:
  * you have no idea how it actually works
* Non-Classified:
  * you can figure out exactly how the information is encrypted

## Digital Signature
* has 3 different parts:

### Classical Cryptography
* AKA symmetrical encryption
  * sender and receiver both using the same key

### Public Key Cryptography
* AKA assymmetrical encryption
  * sender and receiver use different keys

### Cryptographic Checksusm
* AKA Secure Hash

## Cryptosystem
* not just an encryption method, but a whole system (remember the 5 components)
* if any of the elements of the system fail, the system fails
* to know the strength of the security of a system, you must know the strength of security on each element
* Quintuple (E, D, M, K, C)
  * M - plaintextx
  * K - Keys
  * C - ciphertexts
  * E - encryption functions (M x K -> C)
  * D - decryption functions 

### Ceaser Cipher
* has been around for a very long time (thousands of years)
* ciphertext and plaintext are equal length
* plaintext is turned into numbers when it is encrypted
* the key is an integer bewteen 0 and 25 (inclusive)
* all letters get shifted to the right by (key) positions
  * letters at the end wrap around to the beginning of alphabet
* don't get confused by negative modulo operations
  * keep adding the mod number until you get a positive number
  * then do modulo on the positive number

### Attacks
* three types:
  * ciphertext only
    * attacker only has ciphertext
    * goal is to find plaintext, possibly key
  * known plaintext
    * attacker has ciphertext and corresponding plaintext
    * goal is to find the key
  * chosen plaintext
    * attacker supplies plaintext and obtains corresponding ciphertext
    * goal is to find the key

#### Basis for Attacks
* mathematical attacks
  * based on the underlying math of the encryption
* brute force: systematically trying _everything_ 
* for example, WEP encryption has a mathematical flaw 
  * took 15 years to find it
  * once it was found, only takes 5 years to crack
